This is for my own memorires.

These are the albums I listened to the most while coding Corvid.

聖飢魔II
--------
Got it back in my head on holiday walking around singing it with Jose. Started listening to entire discography again
when I got back home.  Man I forgot how awesome their early stuff was!!!

* 1985 - 悪魔が来たりてヘヴィメタる
* 1986 - The End of the Century
* 1992 - 恐怖のレストラン

Symphony X
----------
After hating on this album and not being able to get in it to for ages I just out-of-nowhere decided and I wanted to
listen to it again and now I just suddenly love it! Can't stop listening to it.

* 2011 - Iconoclast

Mudvayne
--------
Was in the mood for something fast, more percussive than melodic, and aggressive. Didn't find it in this but came to
enjoy it for its own merits.

* 2009 - Mudvayne
