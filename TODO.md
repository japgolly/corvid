TODO
====
* Is there a point for `environment.rb`?
* Is there a point for `CORVID_ROOT`?
* Check `APP_ROOT` reliance
* Fix up `corvid --help messages`
* Allow different dir structure than default

ResPatches & Upgrades TODOs
===========================
* Is update() really needed? Currently it needs increments of install() without the `copy_file` stuff. That's stupid...
* Doc the res-patch situation, change process, `rake res:*`, etc.
